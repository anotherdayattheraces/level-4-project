Foscarnet (FOS) has a different mode of action. It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Pyrophosphate</link>

pyrophosphate binding site of pUL54 (note: investigational drug <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Letermovir</link> 
<page>Letermovir</page> 
letermovir acts through a mechanism that involves viral terminase).Two HCMV proteins are implicated in antiviral resistance against these three drugs: pUL97 and pUL54. Specific mutations in pUL97 can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase. Thus, fewer monophosphorylated – and thus active – GCV can be synthesized, leading to antiviral resistance against GCV. About 90% of all GCV resistances are caused by such mutations in UL97. Mutations in pUL54 may have different effects leading to antiviral <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Drug%20resistance</link> 
<page>Drug resistance</page> 
drug resistance: A. They can lead to decreased affinity to antiviral compounds. This resistance mechanism concerns GCV, CDV and FOS and may lead to multidrug resistance. B. Some mutations in pUL54 can increase the polymerase’s <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Exonuclease</link> 
<page>Exonuclease</page> 
exonuclease activity. This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV. As a result, these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently.Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the host’s immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication.HCMV antiviral drug resistance can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing. Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations in order to determine <link tokenizeTagContent="false">EC50</link> 
<page>EC50</page> 
EC50 values. In contrast, genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL97 and UL54 by <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Sequencing</link> 
<page>Sequencing</page> 
sequencing. Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster, but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation. This can be performed via a web-based search tool that links a patient’s HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL97 and UL54 mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes.

In a review that covered 34 masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trials related to diarrhea and probiotics, it was concluded that there was an overall reduction of 52% in antibiotic associated diarrhea, an 8% reduction in traveller’s diarrhea, and a 34% reduction in other types of acute diarrhea. These numbers reflect a protective effect against diarrhea in subjects including both adults and children. In terms of children (age < 18 years), seven out of the 12 trials conducted in a health care setting showed a reduction in acute diarrhea of 57%.

In his textbooks and other writings, Klein introduced a new concept of <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immunology</link> 
<page>Immunology</page> 
immunology, in which he conceived the discipline as a branch of biological sciences, rather than as a narrow province of medical studies, as it had been represented traditionally. He defined <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immunology</link> 
<page>Immunology</page> 
immunology as the science of self-nonself discrimination, concerned not just with the human <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Species</link> 
<page>Species</page> 
species and its animal models (mouse, rabbit, and others), but with all organisms; and not just with issues of human health, but with normal physiological functions, executed with specialized body systems. He was the first to include in an <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immunology</link> 
<page>Immunology</page> 
immunology textbook sections emphasizing the importance of the so-called non-adaptive <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immune</link> 
<page>Immune</page> 
immune system (NAIS; he preferred to call it non-anticipatory). He also gave <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immunology</link> 
<page>Immunology</page> 
immunology a logical internal structure. Instead of organizing his textbooks into sections such as <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Immunochemistry</link>

Sugar sweetened beverages or sugary drinks are beverages that contain any form of added sugars. Out of the entire diet, Americans add sugar to beverages more so than any other product. Sugar-Sweetned beverages or sugary drinks are the leading source of added sugars in the American diet. Added sugars include syrups and other caloric sweeteners. Other examples of added sugars, especially ones that can be listed as an ingredient, include brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, trehalose, and turbinado sugar. The added sugar content is associated with several health concerns like weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, dental implications, and gout. Naturally occurring sugars, such as those in fruit or milk, are not added sugars. Even though there are several beverages/drinks that have sugar in them, some beverages, such as milk, fruit juice, and diet drinks, fall into a “gray” area because of different contributions to health and weight gain is more complex. Sugar-sweetened beverages contain added sugars such as sucrose or fructose, often in large amounts, which contribute to the overall energy density of diets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidance on free sugars. Based on the impact of free sugars intake and its effects on weight gain and dental issues the WHO has taken action on such problems. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Current evidence suggests that increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain. Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can also reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in adults.  For a normal calorie diet, calories from added sugars should be less than 10 percent of the daily calorie limit. Eating habits that include a lesser amount of added sugars, that can be from reduced intake of sugary drinks, can be associated with reduced risk of CVD in adults, and moderate evidence indicates that these eating patterns are associated with reduced risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer in adults.

'''Antimicrobial resistance''' ('''AMR''') is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them.  This broader term also covers '''antibiotic resistance''', which applies to <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Bacteria</link> 
<page>Bacteria</page> 
bacteria and <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Antibiotic</link> 
<page>Antibiotic</page> 
antibiotics. Resistance arises through one of three ways: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria; genetic <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Mutation</link> 
<page>Mutation</page> 
mutation; or by one species acquiring resistance from another. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations; or more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Antibiotic%20misuse</link> 
<page>Antibiotic misuse</page> 
misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials. Resistant microbes are increasingly difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses—which may be more costly or <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Adverse%20effect</link>

Cyclical voltammetry can be used to determine the <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Antioxidant</link> 
<page>Antioxidant</page> 
antioxidant capacity in food and even skin.   Low molecular weight antioxidants, molecules that prevent other molecules from being oxidized by acting as reducing agents, are important in living cells because they inhibit cell damage or death caused by oxidation reactions that produce radicals.   Examples of antioxidants include flavonoids, whose antioxidant activity is greatly increased with more hydroxyl groups.   Because traditional methods to determine antioxidant capacity involve tedious steps, techniques to increase the rate of the experiment are continually being researched.  One such technique involves cyclic voltammetry because it can measure the antioxidant capacity by quickly measuring the redox behavior over a complex system without the need to measure each component’s antioxidant capacity.   Furthermore, antioxidants are quickly oxidized at inert electrodes, so the half-wave potential can be utilized to determine antioxidant capacity.   It is important to note that whenever cyclic voltammetry is utilized, it is usually compared to spectrophotometry or High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC).   Applications of the technique extend to food chemistry, where it is used to determine the antioxidant activity of redwine, chocolate, and hops.  Additionally, it even has uses in the world of medicine in that it can determine antioxidants in the skin.

There have been many studies done to observe the functionality of the primary gustatory cortex and associated structures with various chemical and electrical stimulations as well as observations of patients with lesions and GC epileptic focus.  It has been reported that electrical stimulation of the <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Lingual%20nerve</link>

<page>Field potential</page> 
field potential in the frontal operculum. Electrical stimulation of the insula in the human elicit gustatory sensations.    Gustatory information is conveyed to the orbitofrontal cortex, the secondary gustatory cortex from the AI/FO.  Studies have shown that 8% of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to taste stimuli, and a part of these neurons are finely tuned to particular taste stimuli. It has also been shown in monkeys that the responses of orbitofrontal neurons to taste decreased when the monkey eats to satiety.   Furthermore neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex respond to the visual,and/or <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Olfactory</link> 
<page>Olfactory</page> 
olfactory stimuli in addition to the gustatory stimulus.  These results suggest that gustatory neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex may play an important role in food identification and selection.  A patient study reported that damage in the <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location</link> 
<page>Anatomical terms of location</page> 
rostral part of the insula caused gustatory disturbance, as well as taste recognition and intensity deficits in patients with insular cortex lesions.  It has also been reported that a patient who had an epileptic focus in the frontal operculum and epileptic activity in the focus produced a disagreeable taste.  Activation in the insula also takes place when exposed to gustatory imagery.  Studies compared the activated regions in subjects shown food pictures to those shown location pictures and found that food pictures activated the right insula/operculum and the left orbitofrontal cortex.

Using the idea of equipotentiality we can explain how someone who’s received damage to a specific part of their brain can relearn how to perform actions that were lost due to brain damage. Since the area of the brain that was originally performing this function is damaged and unusable, the brain compensates and can code that information in other parts of the brain. Through Lashley’s ideas of equipotentiality and the law of mass action, he is saying that the brain is functioning as a whole unit and that over all damage to the brain effects it’s over all functioning. This starts to go against localization theories which would say that the brain is only functioning in specific regions and the brain’s ability to perform at any given task is only effected by the overall damage to that area of the brain and damage to an unrelated area shouldn’t affect the task. However, equipotentiality and the law of mass action don’t mean that there is no localization. There are certain functions that have been pinned to specific parts of the brain, language and the senses for example, but for things like learning or behavior there is no specific area identified yet, and these are the brain activities that have the flexibility to be coded in different areas of the brain after damage has be sustained.

A more useful metric is to consider the effects of treatment. If a group of 100 persons all have a 20% ten-year risk of cardiovascular disease it means that we should expect that 20 of these 100 individuals will develop cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke) in the next 10 years and eighty of them will not develop cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. If they were to take a combination of treatments (for example drugs to lower cholesterol levels plus drugs to lower blood pressure) that reduced their risk of cardiovascular disease by half it means that 10 of these 100 individuals should be expected to develop cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years and 90 of them should not be expected to develop cardiovascular disease. If that was the case then 10 of these individuals would have avoided cardiovascular disease by taking treatment for 10 years; 10 would get cardiovascular disease whether or not they took treatment; and 80 would not have got cardiovascular disease whether or not they took treatment.

In the United States, more than 15 million children develop acute diarrhea per year, with the treatment typically being rehydration and recuperative procedures.

In a review that covered 34 masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trials related to diarrhea and probiotics, it was concluded that there was an overall reduction of 52% in antibiotic associated diarrhea, an 8% reduction in traveller’s diarrhea, and a 34% reduction in other types of acute diarrhea. These numbers reflect a protective effect against diarrhea in subjects including both adults and children. In terms of children (age < 18 years), seven out of the 12 trials conducted in a health care setting showed a reduction in acute diarrhea of 57%.

<link tokenizeTagContent="false">Gastrointestinal%20stromal%20tumors</link> 
<page>Gastrointestinal stromal tumors</page> 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are known to withstand cancer chemotherapy treatment and do not respond to any kind of therapy (in 2001) in advanced cases. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitor <link tokenizeTagContent="false">STI571</link> 
<page>STI571</page> 
STI571 (imatinib) is effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors consist of a cluster of mesenchymal neoplasms that are formed from precursors to cells that make up the connective-tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. Most of these tumors are found in the stomach, though they can also be located in the small intestine or elsewhere in the intestinal tract. The cells of these tumors have a growth factor receptor associated with tyrosine kinase activity. This growth factor receptor is called <link tokenizeTagContent="false">C-kit</link> 
<page>C-kit</page> 
c-kit and is produced by a proto-oncogene (''c-kit''). Mutation of c-kit causes the constitutive activity of tyrosine kinase, which results in cancerous gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Results of c-kit mutation include unrestricted tyrosine kinase activity and cell proliferation, unregulated phosphorylation of c-kit, and disruption of some communication pathways.  Therapy with <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Imatinib</link> 
<page>Imatinib</page> 
imatinib can inhibit the non-normal cell signaling mechanisms in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This results in significant responses in patients and sustained disease control. By 2001 it was no longer doubted that this inhibitor can be effective and safe in humans. In similar manner, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was found to significantly reduce the physical size of tumors; they decreased roughly 65% in size in 4 months of trialing, and continued to diminish. New lesions did not appear, and a number of the liver metastases completely reduced to non-existence. The single patient in the study remained healthy following treatment. There are no effective means of treatment for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but that STI571 represents an effective treatment in early stage cancer associated with constitutively active c-kit, by inhibiting unfavourable tyrosine kinase activity.

Since the withdrawal in 2000, mechanisms of Troglitazone hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied using a variety of in vivo, in vitro and computational methods.  These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of Troglitazone results from a combination of two major factors i) Non-metabolic and ii) Metabolic.  The non-metabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system.  Initially the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of Troglitazone.  Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the OH group of the chromane ring.   Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for Troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl (CH3) groups ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring.  This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel Troglitazone derivatives with anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines.

This group of structurally related <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Mycotoxin</link> 
<page>Mycotoxin</page> 
mycotoxins has a strong impact on the health of animals and humans. Trichothecenes are powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis. They do this by reacting with components of the ribosomes: the structure within the cell where proteins are made. The specific site of action of T-2 toxin, which is a reaction with a critical site on the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), is known. Protein synthesis is an essential function in all tissues, but tissues where cells are actively and rapidly growing and dividing are very susceptible to the toxins.Trichothecenes are different from most other potential weapons toxins because they can act through the skin. Compared with some of the other mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, the trichothecenes do not appear to require metabolic activation to exert their biological activity. After direct dermal application or oral ingestion, the trichothecene mycotoxins can cause rapid irritation to the skin or intestinal mucosa. In cell-free systems or single cells in culture, these mycotoxins cause a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis and polyribosomal disaggregation. Thus, we can postulate that the trichothecene mycotoxins have molecular capability of direct reaction with cellular components. Despite this direct effect, it is possible to measure the toxicokinetics and the metabolism of the trichothecene mycotoxins.

pressurized Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a Jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60 dB during use) and is less portable due to a heavier weight. However Jet nebulizers are commonly used for patients in hospitals who have difficulty using inhalers, such as in serious cases of respiratory disease, or severe asthma attacks. The main advantage of the Jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost. If the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pMDI can be rather expensive. Today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the Jet nebulizer down to 635 g, and thereby started to label it as a portable device. Compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers, the noise and heavy weight is however still the biggest draw back of the Jet nebulizer. <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Trade%20name</link>

Numerous studies have shown the pathways and associations between ROS levels and apoptosis, but a newer line of study has connected ROS levels and autophagy. ROS can also induce cell death through autophagy, which is a self-catabolic process involving sequestration of cytoplasmic contents (exhausted or damaged organelles and protein aggregates) for degradation in lysosomes. Therefore, autophagy can also regulate the cell’s health in times of oxidative stress. Autophagy can be induced by ROS levels through many different pathways in the cell in an attempt to dispose of harmful organelles and prevent damage, such as carcinogens, without inducing apoptosis. Autophagic cell death can be prompted by the over expression of autophagy where the cell digests too much of itself in an attempt to minimize the damage and can no longer survive. When this type of cell death occurs, an increase or loss of control of autophagy regulating genes is commonly co-observed. Thus, once a more in-depth understanding of autophagic cell death is attained and it’s relation to ROS, this form of programmed cell death may serve as a future cancer therapy.Autophagy and apoptosis are two different cell death mechanisms brought on by high levels of ROS in the cells, however; autophagy and apoptosis rarely act through strictly independent pathways. There is a clear connection between ROS and autophagy and a correlation seen between excessive amounts of ROS leading to apoptosis. The depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane is also characteristic of the initiation of autophagy. When mitochondria are damaged and begin to release ROS, autophagy is initiated to dispose of the damaging organelle. If a drug targets mitochondria and creates ROS, autophagy may dispose of so many mitochondria and other damaged organelles that the cell is no longer viable. The extensive amount of ROS and mitochondrial damage may also signal for apoptosis. The balance of autophagy within the cell and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis mediated by ROS is crucial for a cell’s survival. This crosstalk and connection between autophagy and apoptosis could be a mechanism targeted by cancer therapies or used in combination therapies for highly resistant cancers.

anxiety disorders. The questionnaire was developed by Boris Birmaher (MD), Suneeta Khetarpal (MD), Marlane Cully (M.ED), David Brent (MD), and Sandra Mackenzie (PhD) in 1997. The SCARED is a brief self-report instrument intended for children, adolescents, and their parents to complete in about 10 minutes, and can discriminate between depression and anxiety, as well as among distinct anxiety disorders. The SCARED is useful for <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Generalized%20anxiety%20disorder</link>

'''Bone pain''' (also known medically by <link tokenizeTagContent="false"></link> 
<page></page> 
several other names) is <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Pain</link> 
<page>Pain</page> 
pain coming from a <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Bone</link> 
<page>Bone</page> 
bone. It occurs as a result of a wide range of diseases and/or physical conditions and may severely impair the quality of life for patients who suffer from it. Bone pain belongs to the class of deep somatic <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Pain</link> 
<page>Pain</page> 
pain, often experienced as a dull pain that cannot be localized accurately by the patient. This is in contrast with the pain which is mediated by superficial receptors in, e.g., the skin. Bone pain can have several possible causes ranging from extensive physical stress to serious diseases such as <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Cancer</link> 
<page>Cancer</page> 
cancer.For many years it has been known that bones are innervated with sensory <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Neuron</link> 
<page>Neuron</page> 
neurons. Yet their exact anatomy remained obscure due to the contrasting physical properties of bone and neural tissue. More recently, it is becoming clear what types of nerves innervated which sections of bone. The periosteal layer of bone tissue is highly pain-sensitive and an important cause of pain in several disease conditions causing bone pain, like <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Bone%20fracture</link> 
<page>Bone fracture</page> 
fractures, <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Osteoarthritis</link>

Another potentially disturbing complication where neuromuscular blockade is employed is '<link tokenizeTagContent="false">Anesthesia%20awareness</link> 
<page>Anesthesia awareness</page> 
anesthesia awareness'. In this situation, patients paralyzed may awaken during their anesthesia, due to an inappropriate decrease in the level of drugs providing sedation and/or pain relief. If this fact is missed by the anesthesia provider, the patient may be aware of his surroundings, but be incapable of moving or communicating that fact. Neurological monitors are increasingly available that may help decrease the incidence of awareness. Most of these monitors use proprietary algorithms monitoring brain activity via evoked potentials. Despite the widespread marketing of these devices many case reports exist in which awareness under anesthesia has occurred despite apparently adequate anesthesia as measured by the neurologic monitor.

Arterial surgery is only indicated once there is positive confirmation that the arteries are indeed the source of pain. Some migraine sufferers have a visibly distended artery on the temple during an attack, which confirms that the arteries are involved. The distention usually subsides as the pain is controlled by vasoconstrictor drugs (<link tokenizeTagContent="false">Ergot</link> 
<page>Ergot</page> 
ergots or <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Triptans</link> 
<page>Triptans</page> 
triptans). In some, this artery is always visible, but it is only when it becomes distended during an attack that it becomes important for diagnosis. Patients who take triptans or ergots for relief of migraine pain are also prime candidates for arterial surgery. The reason for this is that the action of these drugs is to constrict the painfully dilated branches of the external carotid artery - the same arteries that are targeted by the surgery. The purpose of the surgery is to provide a permanent 'triptan or ergot effect'. Most of these arteries are in the scalp and are readily accessible to minimally invasive surgery. This treatment modality is of particular value in: 1) patients who have not responded to preventive drug therapy, 2) patients who are unable to use drug therapy because they experience unacceptable side effects, 3) patients who have to make too frequent use of abortive drugs such as the triptans or ergots, and 4) patients who would prefer not to be on permanent medication. Included in this category are those with Chronic Daily Headache (headache on more than 15 days per month) and patients with what is known as "refractory headache" - headache that has not benefited from any other form of treatment. <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Elliot%20Shevel</link> 
<page>Elliot Shevel</page> 
Elliot Shevel, a South African surgeon, showed that patients with chronic migraine experienced a significant reduction in pain levels and significant improvement in their quality of life following the surgery.

Adoption of the Paleolithic diet assumes that modern humans can reproduce the hunter-gatherer diet. Molecular biologist <link tokenizeTagContent="false">Marion%20Nestle</link> 
<page>Marion Nestle</page> 
Marion Nestle argues that "knowledge of the relative proportions of animal and plant foods in the diets of early humans is circumstantial, incomplete, and debatable and there are insufficient data to identify the composition of a genetically determined optimal diet. The evidence related to Paleolithic diets is best interpreted as supporting the idea that diets based largely on plant foods promote health and longevity, at least under conditions of food abundance and physical activity."
